# Hey, I'm Leo! 👋

#### I love to research, explore, learn new technologies, and build things 💡

#### I've been programming since 2017, and since 2018 I've been programming for a living 💻

#### I try to share my passion for coding with people around me as much as I can because being inspired by technology is what made me love my profession so much ❤️

#### Here are the technologies I have loved to work with professionally throughout my career 💼
