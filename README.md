# Hey, I'm Leo! 👋

#### I love to build things, learn, research, and explore technologies 💡

#### I've been programming since 2017, and since early 2018 I've been programming for a living 💻

#### I try to share my passion about coding with people around me as much as I can, because being inspired by technology is what made me love my profession so much ❤️

#### Here are the technologies I have been loving to work with professionally through my career 💼
