# Hello, I'm Leo! 👋

I've been coding since 2017 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a software engineer who loves to build web applications, from back-end to front-end. ⚒️

Since 2018, I worked in the finance, healthcare, and SaaS sectors 💻

I try to share my passion for coding with people around me as much as I can because being inspired by technology is what made me love my profession ❤️

The following technologies are the ones I'm most experienced with (descending order) 💼
