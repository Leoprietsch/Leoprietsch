# Hello, I'm Leo! 👋

I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer who loves to build web applications, from back-end to front-end. ⚒️

I've been researching, exploring, and learning new technologies when building new things since 2017 💡

I've been programming for a living since 2018, having experiences in sectors like finance, healthcare, and SaaS  💻

I try to share my passion for coding with people around me as much as I can because being inspired by technology is what made me love my profession ❤️

Here are the technologies I have professional experience with 💼
